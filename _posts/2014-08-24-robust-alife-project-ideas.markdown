The following is a list of project ideas for the Robust Artificial Life class
I'm taking at UNM this semester. This is a course taught by David Ackley for
an introduction to the robust first computing mantra please see the video he's
posted on his 
[YouTube channel here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=helScS3coAE&feature=youtu.be). 

A common theme I'm interested in investigating is using cellular automata to
simulate different factions (societies, cells, groups) and which civilizations
rise and fall; what groups of organisms flourish or fail based off of initial
configurations, internal variables, and external factors. Also, analyzing how
the environment affects these lifeforms is another area that can be
investigated.

In general, I am more interested in investigating events on the macroscopic
(plants, animals, humans, societies, galaxies) scale than on the microscopic
scale (atoms, molecules, chemistry) due to my background knowledge.

Stay tuned for elaborations on the proposed projects.

## (1) War simulation

Two or more different factions with different unit kinds. One faction can have
multiple unit types and cannot harm members of the same factions.

## (2) Civilization simulation

"City builders" vs "road builders". Building simple city structures and routes
that connect these cities. 

There could possibly be two elements: 

* One that works together to build buildings. (City builders).
* One that works together to build roads. (Road builders).

Study on how to build structures that can withstand catastrophic events, small
errors, etc. The catastrophic events could be drawn by en external god-like
character (you) or there could be additional elements introduced that live to
cause chaos in the roads and buildings (Barbarians).

## (3) Species simulation

This project would be focused on allowing the definition of various creatures
that are either prey or predators and simulating genetic inheritance.

A feature I would like to add would be a "creature editor" that would allow
the definition of traits: such as mass, metabolic rate, what it eats, etc. on
the fly such that additional plants and animals could be introduced simply by
defining certain attributes.

I would also like to define environmental factors such as water, terrain,
natural disasters, and other events to simulate how these species adapt to
catastrophic events -- think of a simulation of dinosaurs and a meteor impact
as a possible simulation.
