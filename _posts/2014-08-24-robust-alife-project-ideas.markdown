The following is a list of project ideas for robust artificial life. A common
theme I'm interested in investigating are using cellular automata to simulate
difference factions (societies, cells, groups) and which civilizations rise
and fall; what groups of organisms flourish or fail based off of initial
configurations, internal variables, and external factors. Also, analyzing how
the environment affects these lifeforms is another area that is interesting to
me.

Stay tuned for elaborations on the proposed projects.

## (1) War simulation

Two or more different factions with different unit kinds. One faction can have
multiple unit types and cannot harm members of the same factions.

## (2) Civilization simulation

"City builders" vs "road builders". Building simple city structures and routes
that connect these cities. 

There could possibly be two elements: 

* One that works together to build buildings. (City builders).
* One that works together to build roads. (Road builders).

Study on how to build structures that can withstand catastrophic events, small
errors, etc. The catastrophic events could be drawn by en external god-like
character (you) or there could be additional elements introduced that live to
cause chaos in the roads and buildings (Barbarians).
