I would like to work at a place that values cutting-edge technology while at
the same time values the robustness, extensibility, and modularity of future
technologies and frameworks. This does not mean that my ideal company is
always jumping to the latest and shiniest Javascript framework that pops up
and abandoning years of hard work. This can be embodied as a dedication to
modern practices, for example, using the new functional features of C++11 or
Java 8 or simply as a dedication to not compromise the freedom of expression
for developers by sticking to legacy versions of programming languages and
frameworks.
