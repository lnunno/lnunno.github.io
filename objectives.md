## My ideal company

### Is on the cutting edge

I would like to work at a place that values cutting-edge technology while at
the same time values the robustness, extensibility, and modularity of future
technologies and frameworks. This does not mean that my ideal company is
always jumping to the latest and shiniest Javascript framework that pops up
and abandoning years of hard work. This can be embodied as a dedication to
modern practices, for example, using the new functional features of C++11 or
Java 8 or simply as a dedication to not compromise the freedom of expression
for developers by sticking to legacy versions of programming languages and
frameworks.

My ideal company changes the world of technology in a positive way quickly,
robustly, and intelligently. 

### Gives me the ability to make an impact

### Has meaningful and interesting work

A large portion of my life will be spent working and evolving my career. One
of my primary career goals is to always be engaged in meaningful work that is
intellectually challenging and interesting. One of the only ways to improve as
a software engineer is to constantly be challenged and pushed to the next
level; this includes learning new things as well as managing complexity.

My ideal company provides the opportunity for its employees to grow
personally and professionally, because it knows that this will also increase
its bottom line by investing in the future.

### Maintains the work-life balance

My ideal company values the physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing of its
employees. This means that there exists a fulfilling life outside of work that
the company actively encourages me to pursue.
