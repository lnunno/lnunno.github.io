I'm a Software Engineer at Sandia National Labs in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

If I could pick any technology to write software in I'd probably choose a Python backend with Flask and a TypeScript frontend with React. I've found this combination to be productive and scale well.

I use antigen to manage my zsh environment and Vundle to manage my vim extensions. I've also written a number of Ansible roles to manage my environment.

I like to rock climb, hike, swim, and play video games.
